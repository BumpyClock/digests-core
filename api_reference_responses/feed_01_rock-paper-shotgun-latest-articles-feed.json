      "description": "Update: In a statement to RPS, Skyblivion comms lead Evan T. Flatt remphasised that when it comes to spellcrafting, while the team would love to deliver it down the line: \"We can't guarantee it will be possible - largely due to the technical hurdles of doing so and the very limited number of people skilled in being able to do it.\" \n \"As far as concerns that our UI Lead, Fallen, wasn't included in contributing to the delay announcement, that would be inaccurate,\" Flatt continued. \"He did not have a direct role in the video production, including filming and editing, but he did help review the script for accuracy (as did all department leads). After chatting with him, the confusion on his end was due to the time interval between us finishing the script and the video being finished, in which he forgot he had worked on the script.\" \n Original story follows: \n Skyblivion , the massive modding project reinterpreting The Elder Scrolls 4 via Skyrim 's engine, had its release officially delayed to 2026 earlier this week. The delay followed an ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes alleging that the mod's previous 2025 release goal was \"unachievable\" earlier this year, in a post which also accused Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and implementation lead Heavy Burns of mismanaging communication within the mod's team. In response, Heavy Burns asserted that \"many\" of the claims in the ex-dev's post were \"either misrepresented or just untrue\". \n Now, in a Discord discussion emphasising that players shouldn't assume the spellcrafting mechanic the modders have had to cut from the initial release will be put back in down the line, Skyblivion's UI department lead has suggested they weren't consulted about what was said in the YouTube video announcing the mod's delay to next year. That'd be the delay announcement video which features a section specifically dedicated to the current status of Skyblivion's UI and mechanics. \n Read more",

      "description": "Update: Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has provided some clarificiation of the FAQ answer outlining the reasons the studio aren't launching Hytale on Steam right out of the gate. \"The wording around 'over-indexing' was confusing and misinterpreted by many, making it sound like we were avoiding Steam because of negative reviews,\" he wrote in a post on the tweeter explaining the need for the update, taking responsibility on his and executive director Patrick 'Lyall' Derbic's parts for not being clear enough in their phrasing. \n \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with our existing community to improve the game, rather than chasing a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction,\" the meat of the FAQ response now reads. \"We don't shy away from honest, negative criticism; we have been very critical of the state of the game ourselves on social media. We simply want the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game's development background.\" \n Original story follows: \n Revived Minecraft y survivabuilder Hytale got a fresh early access release date of January 13th the other week. However, the team behind it how now confirmed you shouldn't expect to see it hit Steam at that point, with the game's executive director not seeing the need to knock on Valve's pipe-laden door yet and keen to avoid an early access spent drowning in negative reviews. \n Read more",

In the late 1870s, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge produced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion\">a series of \"chronophotographs\" of horses and riders</a>, including the famous 12-frame sequence Sallie Gardner at a Gallop. I know about Muybridge's work thanks to Jordan Peele's film Nope, which considers the historical erasure of Sallie Gardner's Black jockey, whose identity is disputed. Another thing that easily gets overlooked when considering these images is their contribution to the practice of horse-breeding. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nMuybridge - who, incidentally, murdered his wife's lover, which doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here - captured the images after many years of tinkering with shutters, triggers and emulsions, but they were commissioned by the industrialist Leland Stanford, founder of the university of the same name. Stanford kept racehorses, and wanted a more precise understanding of their movements, with the obvious wider motive of being able to raise more champions; nowadays, gait analysis by means of video capture is commonplace among breeders. Muybridge's breakthrough in terms of <em>photographic</em> reproduction is thus an important development in control of <em>equine</em> reproduction. To stretch that point a little, you could argue that the moving picture has always been a way of disciplining sex - and one animal may seem much like another, once reduced to a quantity of frames.\r\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review\">Read more</a></p>",

We'd be long past the point of spotting a spectral Jolly Roger between stormy crests, its deathshead wreathed in St. Elmo's Fire. The damn ghost ship is square abreast of us now, the hollow-cheeked revenant of Edward Kenway dangling from the rigging.\r\n</p>\n<p>People keep pointing at the ghost ship and screaming, but Captain Ubisoft has his eyes firmly on the horizon. \"Steady as she goes, lads!\" he trills, as hordes of translucent pirates pour over the rail. \"Steady as she goes till some hypothetical future time when we might announce a thing, maybe!\"\r\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers\">Read more</a></p>",

Yes, it is still a roguelike in which you split your time between piloting a robotic spider up and down a giant wall in search of weak spots from which you can mine deep into the cliff face, digging up minerals to spend upgrading your mecha-arachnid's weapons, enhancing its ability to fight off periodic waves of pustule-covered aliens, until you either kill the biggest pustule-covered alien or die in the attempt. But now it's become a much more complex game, embellishing both its mining and combat halves and thinning the divide between them. \n This is going to take a little explaining, with a lot of changes falling into the plus and minus columns, so here's an easy improvement to tide you over. You can now name your robospider; mine is called Nigel. \n Read more",
