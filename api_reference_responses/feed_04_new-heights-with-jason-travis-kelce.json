      "description": "92%ers, welcome to this week’s episode of New Heights brought to you by YETI! Today, we are joined by Hollywood icon George Clooney! But first, we recap Jason’s militia adventures in New England, break down our New Heights Belly Bucking tailgate at the Linc, we try to figure out how the Chiefs will be “tickling your tonsils,” Jason explains why he’s still hopeful for the Eagles, we go over the intricacies of NFL shit talk, and try and relate to Ole Miss as they head into the college football playoff without head coach Lane Kiffin. Finally, we sit down with George Clooney to talk about everything from his Cincinnati Bearcat roots, working with Adam Sandler on his new film “Jay Kelly,” his secret to a successful marriage, parenting advice, where he ranks Jason as Fat Batman, his new career low, and so much more!

On today’s episode, we’Ve got some huge new news about being included in the “Best Pods of 2025” list, a special guest episode announcement, and we are all in on “Belly Bucking” at the Linc. This will make sense, just trust us. We also get into everything from week 11 in the NFL including Travis’ thoughts on what the .500 Chiefs need to do the rest of the season, why Jason still has some concerns about the Birds, Jameis Winston’s return to the field, what is next for Shedeur Sanders, and why we’re giving out some stamps to some huge plays from tight ends. And of course, we weigh in on the Cam Skattebo “Taco Debate.” We’ve got even more New Heights this week with our Heights Hotline Holiday Hot Takes episode airing this Friday and an incredible guest episode coming out Monday 11/24.

      "description": "92%ers, welcome to another episode of New Heights brought to you by Audible! On today’s episode, we are joined by friend of the show and star of the upcoming film ‘Eternity,’ Miles Teller! Before we talk to Miles we get into everything from week 11 in the NFL including Jason having a “Freaky Friday” moment with Peyton Manning, what Travis got up to on the bye week, a chaotic food tour of Lambeau, a recap of the wild ending of Eagles/Packers, the guys thoughts on Kafka taking over in New York, drive by trolling, and so many thoughts on Dan Campbell’s new glasses. Finally, we talk to Miles Teller about his new film ‘Eternity,’ why he trusts Jalen Hurts, who he’s siding with in our “Tahoe Bet,” how Tom Cruise changed his approach to being a leading man, why he used to DM Kobe his 2k scores, the guys answer some of his NFL questions, and we find out why he took a few shots to the ribs in a Super Bowl suite.

Finally, we hand out some stamps of the week, debate kickers wearing shorts, Jason reveals why he didn’t love the World Series, and we attempt to answer your pet advice voicemails.

On today’s episode, we get Jason’s review of 1587, Travis reacts to his record-breaking game against the Commanders, and explains why the Chiefs are “AAF.” We also look at the rest of a blowout-filled Week 8 with the Eagles running over the Giants, Jason gives his thoughts on the weird tush push missed call, Jets Jake takes a victory lap after getting his first win of the season, we look at some absurd plays from Jonathan Taylor, and hand out some Stamps of the Week. Finally, we celebrate the spooky season and crown a winner of the New Heights Halloween Costume contest, give some advice to dudes in their 30s, look back at some vintage Kelce childhood Halloween costumes, and Travis gives us maybe the best Luigi impression we’ve ever heard.

      "description": "92%ers, welcome to another episode of New Heights brought to you by WhatsApp! On today’s episode, we are joined by the NBA Hall-of-Famer, Allen Iverson But first, we’ve got a little new news because Travis and Jason are officially in the theme park business. Get all the details behind Travis’ decision to join up with Six Flags, what the ideal Kelce Coaster would look like, and why there might be wild otters running loose at Cedar Point very soon. We also recap everything from week 7 in the NFL including the Chiefs blowout win over the Raiders, Travis’ thoughts on the Chiefs offense with Rashee Rice back in the lineup, and what Jason needs to order at 1587 next week. We also break down the Eagles win over the Vikings, get Jason’s thoughts on Brandon Graham’s return to the Eagles, how close he might be to putting the pads back on, reaction to the wild finish in Denver, and why we’re at war with time zones. Later we are joined by an incredible guest for a very special stamp of the week so he can explain why he has a pin up tattoo of Jake on his leg. Finally we’ve got NBA legend Allen Iverson! We get his thoughts on his new documentary, how close he came to choosing football over basketball, what he really thinks about Philly fans, the origin of his signature arm sleeve, how he feels about seeing other players do the “step over,” and why he’s still star struck by Michael Jordan.

On today’s episode, we are joined by the nicest guy in Hollywood, Keanu Reeves But first, we recap everything from week 6 in the NFL, including Travis taking a header in the Chiefs big win over the Lions, Jason’s thoughts on the birds, debate who might already have a lead in the NFL MVP race, and explain why the NFL needs more lovable meat heads. Finally, we’ve got Hollywood legend Keanu Reeves! We get his thoughts about playing an angel in his new movie “Good Fortune,” the ideal candidate for a body swap, his background tending goal on the ice, why he thinks we might have missed the point of “The Matrix,” his worst on-set injury, a little life advice, and so much more.

      "description": "92%ers, welcome to another episode of New Heights brought to you by Peloton! On today’s episode, we get right into Jason and Travis’ reactions to the album you first heard about on this show, Taylor Swift’s “Life of a Showgirl.” We get into Jason’s favorite songs, how Travis felt watching this album come to life, which song is on repeat in the Kelce house, and Jason’s thoughts on “Wood.” We also talk a little football and recap the Chiefs coming up short against the Jags in a wild Monday Night Football game, the Eagles taking their first loss against the Broncos, and the rest of a wild week 5 in the NFL, including fumbled INTs, fumbled TDs, and a pitch to leave the Jets in England. Jason also recaps his time outta the house in Jacksonville, where he somehow joined a Beer League Hockey team, and we hand out some Stamps of the Week to some 92%ers who took Halloween to New Heights.

      "description": "92%ers, welcome to another episode of New Heights brought to you by Peloton! Travis breaks down the Chiefs offense, finally getting rolling against the Ravens, what it felt like to get Xavier Worthy back, and Patty Mahomes breaking even more records. Jason dives into the Eagles big win in Tampa, explains why the AJ Brown tweets are actually a good thing, and lets us know which Broncos player is on notice next week. We also look at everything else from an exciting week 4 including why we love coach fights, who had that most down bad quote of the week, how we’d fix the embarrassment that is a tie game, Jason recaps his time in Ireland, and we hand out a very long awaited Stamp of the fucking Week.

      "description": "92%ers, welcome to another episode of New Heights brought to you by Reese’s Oreo® Cups! Today, we are joined by the incredible host of The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon! Jimmy joins us to talk about everything from throwing putters into lakes, the secrets to talking football on TV, how to plan a wedding, and he’s got an incredible pitch to Travis for an end zone celebration. Jason and Travis also talk about everything else from Week 2 in the NFL. We get into the Chiefs coming up short against the Eagles and how he’s feeling about that goal line drop, what the league might do to the “tush push,” why players' only meetings might be a waste of time, Baker’s incredible comeback, and so much more! We also take some of your calls on the Heights Hotline about getting pulled over, turf toe, and potty training secrets. We will be back Monday 9/22 with Coach Prime himself, Deion Sanders! For more Jimmy Fallon, Watch the Tonight Show after SNF starting 9/21 and On Brand starting Tuesday, September 30 at 10/9c on NBC and streaming on Peacock. https://youtu.be/1DB8J12wj8E?si=Ouc9frLInWK-WvAr Watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights every Wednesday during the NFL season and follow us on Social Media for all the best moments from the show: https://lnk.to/newheightshow You can also listen to new episodes early and ad-free on Wondery+.

Jason and Travis also talk about everything else from Week 2 in the NFL. We get into the Chiefs coming up short against the Eagles and how he’s feeling about that goal line drop, what the league might do to the “tush push,” why players' only meetings might be a waste of time, Baker’s incredible comeback, and so much more! We also take some of your calls on the Heights Hotline about getting pulled over, turf toe, and potty training secrets. We will be back Monday 9/22 with Coach Prime himself, Deion Sanders!

      "description": "92%ers, welcome to another episode of New Heights brought to you by Reese’s Oreo® Cups! We’ve got an amazing episode for you today recapping all the insanity that was week 1 in the NFL and we have an incredible conversation with Rob Riggle and Kevin Hart to preview next week’s Chiefs/Eagles game! First, Travis recaps the Chiefs time down in Brazil. We get into what happened on the collision with Xavier Worthy, the fire drill field goal, and what the Chiefs are taking away from the loss to the Chargers. Jason also gives us all the details on the Eagles game against the Cowboys. We get into how he feels about “spitgate,” AJ Brown not getting the ball, and how we can fix weather delays. We also touch on everything from around the league including the absolute banger that was the Sunday Night Football game between the Ravens and Bills, why WR1s struggled out the gate, which veteran QB has found the best new home, and so much more! Finally, Rob Riggle and Kevin Hart face off in our first ever fan off. They fight about who has the better home crowd, the special kind of mayhem that is a Philly game day, share some incredible heckling stories, reveal why Kevin is on the “threat list” at the Linc, and most importantly, make their case for who’s winning on Sunday.

We get into what happened on the collision with Xavier Worthy, the fire drill field goal, and what the Chiefs are taking away from the loss to the Chargers. \n\nJason also gives us all the details on the Eagles game against the Cowboys. We get into how he feels about “spitgate,” AJ Brown not getting the ball, and how we can fix weather delays. \n\nWe also touch on everything from around the league including the absolute banger that was the Sunday Night Football game between the Ravens and Bills, why WR1s struggled out the gate, which veteran QB has found the best new home, and so much more!  \n\nFinally, Rob Riggle and Kevin Hart face off in our first ever fan off. They fight about who has the better home crowd, the special kind of mayhem that is a Philly game day, share some incredible heckling stories, reveal why Kevin is on the “threat list” at the Linc, and most importantly, make their case for who’s winning on Sunday. \n\nCheck out Rob’s Book: Grit, Spit, and Never Quit.

      "description": "92%ers welcome back another episode of New Heights, brought to you by our friends at General Mills’s Favorite Cereal Brands! We’ve got an incredible episode to wrap up season 3! First, we welcome back Adam Sandler to talk all things Happy Gilmore 2, how Travis’ scenes with Bad Bunny turned out, Big Ed’s cameo, and the origins of the iconic Happy Gilmore swing. Next, we check in with Travis and how he’s feeling going into his 13 training camp at St. Joe’s, attempt to explain what the hell is going on with the NFLPA’s corporate credit card, take a look at some fan mentions about Jason lawn art, the Jets Jake Tattoo, and caffeinated cupcakes. And we’re not even close to done yet because we finally give our long-awaited review of the 1990 classic “Pretty Woman.” See if Jason and Travis think the film holds up, what they thought of Julia Roberts’ Oscar-nominated performance, and who was the sneaky MVP of the movie. Finally, we have an incredible conversation with #1 draft pick, Heisman winner, and starting QB for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Baker Mayfield! We get into everything from why he thinks the Bucs have some unfinished business heading into this season, his early days as a walk-on QB, his iconic duel against Mahomes in 2016, the importance of being a “football house guy,” how he started a game for the Rams in less than 48 hours, shit talking strategies, relationship with Mike Evans, being a girl dad, getting welcome to the NFL by Fletcher Cox, and more! And that wraps up season 3 of New Heights! We have to thank all the 92%ers who tuned in this season, all of the incredible guests who gave us their time, and the amazing crew that helped produce this show every week. We will be back August 27th with new episodes to kick off the NFL Season! For even more New Heights, check out our New Heights YouTube Membership!

      "description": "92%ers welcome back another episode of New Heights, brought to you by our friends at General Mills’s Favorite Cereal Brands! On today’s episode, Jason and Travis recap the amazing weekend in Tahoe. We talk about everything from the “Bacon Bet,” losing the karaoke contest to Ray Romano, how Jason won an MVP trophy for something other than golf, and Travis thanks the spectators willing to take one for the team. We also take a call about relationship advice from the Heights Hotline. As it turns out, this show is pro-nagging and Kylie might need a whistle. And we’ve got an incredible conversation with Zac Brown! Zac fills us in on how he’s prepping for an amazing run of shows at the Las Vegas spheres, which music legends lent their talents to the new Zac Brown album, why Jason needs to get over his fear of sharks and go spearfishing, his approach to song writing, what life is really like on a tour bus, the benefits of giving kids knives, and so much more!

      "description": "92%ers welcome back another episode of New Heights, brought to you by our friends at Audible! On today’s episode, we did it, we finally figured out the next movie for New Heights Film Club, Travis also lets us in on a bet he has for this week’s American Century Championship, and we learn about the complexities of NFL team group chats. And we’ve got a great conversation with Chiefs Offensive Coordinator, Matt Nagy! Coach Nagy gives us his side of the story about “helping” Mahomes in his pre-draft interview, how he almost started for the Eagles, what Chiefs fans can expect from a fully healthy offense this season, the time he almost had to save Coach Reid’s life, Jason’s rookie year crash-out, his first impression of Travis, which NFL defender he hates game planning for, and more!

      "description": "92%ers welcome back another episode of New Heights, brought to you by our friends at Audible! On today’s episode, we're still figuring out the next movie in the New Heights Film Club, react to “Pin-Up Travis,” and show off some brand-new uniforms from the University of Cincinnati. Jason reveals all the chaos from year 5 of the shorebirds, which featured bikini waxes, charity speedos, and we find out who limped away from the stupidity that was Beer Bowl III. Travis breaks down everything that happened in Nashville at TEU, from getting to meet Jeremy Shockey, all the knowledge he dropped on his fellow TEs, and all of the celebrity surprises you might have heard about. And finally, we had a great conversation with Hollywood legend and star of F1: The Movie, Brad Pitt. The guys talk about the crazy behind the scenes production of this movie, our shared love of sports movies, Brad’s favorite Chief’s moments, how he ended up getting abducted on “jackass,” why he’s always eating in movies, and more!

We discuss how being a Dad has changed over the years, the unwritten rules of the Kelce household, the backstory behind Travis’ shampoo bottle prank, Ed’s thoughts on Pin-Up Jason, why Ed is the Al Bundy of dads, and how Jason and Travis learned about the birds and the bees.

      "description": "92%ers welcome back to a very special episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Allstate! Today, we are joined by NFL legends and fellow podcasters, Andrew Whitworth and Ryan Fitzpatrick! Before we get to our guests, we react to what we know about the 2025 NFL schedule and the rumors about the Chiefs heading overseas. We also reveal why we’re big fans of the Chicago Pope, what’s going down at this year’s Tight End U, and how you could win a trip to “Caddy with the Kelces.” Later, Fitz and Whit join us for an incredible conversation where discuss everything from holiday games at Travis’ house, hysterical stories about being ejected, a definitive answer on the QB hand size debate, big Whit’s thoughts on fellow LSU tackle Will Campbell, Fitz’s favorite stop on his nine-team career, when they knew it was time to hang it up, and so much more!

      "description": "92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Dunkin’! Today, Jason and Travis recap the Chiefs and Eagles draft classes, reveal why they secretly love the Browns’ Shadeur Sanders pick, and explain why “character concerns” are overrated. We’ve also got an incredible conversation with Hollywood icon Ben Affleck. We discuss why The Account hits home for Jason, how building a culture on a movie set is the same as in an NFL locker room, which Boston team is secretly his favorite, his life-changing experience of running routes for Tom Brady, why Ben is sick of Matt Damon’s abs, and more! Stick around until the end for a recap of Jason and Travis' time at the 8am Golf Tournament and our attempt to solve the “Gorilla Fight Debate.” For even more New Heights, check out our New Heights YouTube Membership!

      "content": "92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Dunkin’! Today, Jason and Travis recap the Chiefs and Eagles draft classes, reveal why they secretly love the Browns’ Shadeur Sanders pick, and explain why “character concerns” are overrated. We’ve also got an incredible conversation with Hollywood icon Ben Affleck. We discuss why The Account hits home for Jason, how building a culture on a movie set is the same as in an NFL locker room, which Boston team is secretly his favorite, his life-changing experience of running routes for Tom Brady, why Ben is sick of Matt Damon’s abs, and more! Stick around until the end for a recap of Jason and Travis' time at the 8am Golf Tournament and our attempt to solve the “Gorilla Fight Debate.” For even more New Heights, check out our New Heights YouTube Membership!

      "description": "92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Suave Men. Check out their no-nonsense self-care today! On today’s episode, we’re joined by Cleveland Browns legend and NFL Hall of Famer, Joe Thomas! Before we get to Joe, Jason and Travis catch up by breaking down the greatest Easter tweet of all time and announcing the movies we need you to vote on for the next edition of the New Heights Film Club. Joe Thomas joins us to share his hysterical reason he skipped the NFL Draft, the wild story about meeting his starting QB for the first time while in the huddle, and how he really feels about all those Browns losing records. We also get into how he mentored a young Myles Garrett, we answer a not-dumb question about finger liquid, and why he might be headed to a “Beef Off” with Jason.

      "description": "92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Suave Men! On today’s episode, we find out how Jason feels about his Sports Emmy nomination, which R-rated movies were allowed in the Kelce house growing up, and we recap Rory McIlroy’s emotional roller coaster of a win at The Masters. We also dive into the NFL offseason and discuss which workouts are actually helpful, what advice the guys would give rookies, and why Jason still doesn’t believe in stretching. We also kick off our first-ever conversation with an NFL expert. Today we are joined by former Eagles VP of Football Administration, Jake Rosenberg, who graciously answers all of our dumb questions about the salary cap. If you enjoyed our conversation with Jake, make sure to give him a follow on Twitter https://x.com/jakerosenberg33 and check out https://theathletegroup.com/ For even more New Heights, check out our New Heights YouTube Membership!

      "description": "92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights! Once again brought to you by the HBO Original series The Last of Us premiering Sunday at 9 PM on Max! Today we are joined by Eagles legend Brandon Graham! Brandon and the guys get into everything from his emotional retirement announcement, his relationship with Philadelphia fans, the one play he would ban in the NFL, and his new children’s book. We also get into his relationship with Andy Reid, his favorite Jason Kelce rookie stories, how much research goes into his trash-talking, if he can remember all the QBs he’s sacked, and how often he’s asked about his iconic Super Bowl sack of Tom Brady. After the Brandon Graham convo, Jason and Travis offer the best golf advice that two football players can offer and we dive into a chain gang conspiracy theory.

Jayson and the guys break down everything from the new Celtics ownership, Jayson’s thoughts on Duke’s title chances, why he’s so impressed with Cooper Flagg, what it was like playing for Coach K, how close he was to becoming a Laker, the NFL players in the NBA debate, if he could hoop in flip flops and so much more! \n\nMake sure to check out our New Heights YouTube Membership!

      "description": "92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by Nike! When the world says you can’t win, Nike says, “So Win” On today’s episode, Jason and Travis weigh in on the latest news from NFL Free Agency including revealing how much players snitch on their old teams, why the Cowboys are fighting online, and if the Bengals made the right call by signing Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins to record-breaking contracts. We also have an incredible conversation with Ben Stiller. We get into everything from the guy's love of “Heavyweights”, what really happens at NFL training camps, who’s idea it was for Tom Cruise to dance in “Tropic Thunder”, if Ben would give up an Academy Award for a Knicks Title, and all of Jason and Travis’ biggest questions about “Severance.” Finally, we have potentially the least helpful March Madness breakdown of all time. If your criteria for picking teams involve fighting ability, if they shoot underhand free throws, higher GPAs, or any other broad generalizations, this bracket preview is for you!

Join us for a beauty of an episode, fresh off the 4 Nations Face-Off we’ve got Matthew and Brady Tkachuk! Matt and Brady recap everything about the 4 Nations tournament including how they felt watching each other drop the gloves against Canada, what they talked about in the penalty box, the secrets of hockey fights, and what’s next for hockey fandom in the USA. We also get into the Tkachuk’s path to the NHL, growing up the sons of a hockey legend, Travis “cheating” at drinking games, and the greatest chirp they’ve ever heard. Finally, we discuss Travis’ new movie, Jason’s time at the Eagles parade, a Gritty conspiracy theory, and we ask the 92%ers to help us plan our offseason.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by Buffalo Wild Wings Go! Today, we are coming to you in person from the home of Super Bowl LIX, New Orleans Louisiana! We’ve got an incredible episode, the Manning brothers join us to talk all things Super Bowl LIX, their relationships with Mahomes and Hurts, the backstory behind Peyton’s viral moment with Jeff Saturday, if either of them would’ve liked playing with Travis, and who would’ve won the hypothetical, “Manning Bowl.” We also sample some authentic New Orleans food, Jason learns how to eat a crawfish, Travis gives his final thoughts before the game, we figure out if Travis is a time traveller or not, and so much more! New Heights will be back next Wednesday to recap Super Bowl LIX and get into what we have planned for the offseason. You can listen to new episodes early and ad-free on Wondery+.

Today, we are coming to you in person from the home of Super Bowl LIX, New Orleans Louisiana! We’ve got an incredible episode, the Manning brothers join us to talk all things Super Bowl LIX, their relationships with Mahomes and Hurts, the backstory behind Peyton’s viral moment with Jeff Saturday, if either of them would’ve liked playing with Travis, and who would’ve won the hypothetical, “Manning Bowl.” We also sample some authentic New Orleans food, Jason learns how to eat a crawfish, Travis gives his final thoughts before the game, we figure out if Travis is a time traveller or not, and so much more! New Heights will be back next Wednesday to recap Super Bowl LIX and get into what we have planned for the offseason. You can listen to new episodes early and ad-free on Wondery+.

      "description": "92%ers this is for you! We’ve got King James himself stopping by on this episode of New Heights presented by Hershey’s. Shop Reese's Chocolate Lava Big Cup now at a store near you. LeBron sits down with Jason and Travis to talk all things Wild Card Weekend, how close he came to playing in the NFL, some of his favorite times hooping in Cleveland, the Championship that means the most to him, and his real thoughts on playing with Bronny. We also settle the debate on which league owns Christmas, get the backstory on a legendary pick-up game against Michael Jordan, and find out how much longer “this fuckery” can go on. Finally, as promised, we look ahead to the divisional round of the playoffs and blindly rank our favorite Will Ferrell movies.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by Audible! Start listening today when you sign up for a free 30 day trial at https://audible.com/newheights We’ve got a lot to catch up on this episode. Starting with recapping how we spent the Holidays, how Travis feels about the mayhem at the Mayo Bowl, Jason recapping his late night debut, and an incredible guest announcement. Later, we get Travis’ thoughts on breaking Tony Gonzalez's TD record, how he feels about the debate surrounding the Chiefs resting starters, and if he was sick of the Chiefs being stuck on a plane. We also touch on the Eagles resting Saquon, what Wild Card games are going to be the most electric, and try to blindly rank the top ten plays of the NFL regular season.

Start listening today when you sign up for a free 30 day trial at https://audible.com/newheights We’ve got a lot to catch up on this episode. Starting with recapping how we spent the Holidays, how Travis feels about the mayhem at the Mayo Bowl, Jason recapping his late night debut, and an incredible guest announcement. Later, we get Travis’ thoughts on breaking Tony Gonzalez's TD record, how he feels about the debate surrounding the Chiefs resting starters, and if he was sick of the Chiefs being stuck on a plane. We also touch on the Eagles resting Saquon, what Wild Card games are going to be the most electric, and try to blindly rank the top ten plays of the NFL regular season.

      "description": "Happy New Year 92%ers, we’ve got an incredible episode to kick off 2025. Joining us today is WNBA Rookie of the Year, Caitlin Clark! Caitlin and the guys talk about everything from winning Time Magazine’s Athlete of the Year, why she isn’t a bandwagon Chiefs fan, what it was really like hanging with Travis at the Eras tour, and the biggest takeaways from her historic rookie season. We also find out just how close she came to playing for Notre Dame, who can name the most Iowa NFL players, pitch ideas to help the NBA ratings, her GOAT basketball shoe, and so much more.

Join your friends and see why millions of people are hooked on playing this game every day! In this special holiday episode, we are joined by the host of “Not Gonna Lie” herself, Kylie Kelce! Kylie joins us to debate if “Love Actually” is even a Christmas movie, what Jason thought was the most ridiculous storyline, and which character gets aggressively labeled a “ho.” We also touch on why ‘Christmas Vacation’ might be the perfect holiday family movie, attempt a chaotic blind ranking of all-time Christmas movies, and give some advice for what to do if someone you love is a bad gift giver.

      "description": "92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV. Right now you can get NFL Sunday Ticket for just 89 dollars. Offer ends December 2, Terms and embargoes apply. In this episode, we learn about some brand-new additions to the Kelce universe, a late-night show, and Jason and Kylie's baby #4. Travis also breaks down another Chief’s close call in Carolina, including the unsung hero of Patrick Mahomes’ fourth-quarter scramble, the emergence of Noah Gray, and what advice Andy Reid gave them about playing on Black Friday. We also get to the rest of a chaotic Week 12 in the NFL that featured Saquon and the Eagles running all over the Rams, the insane ending of Cowboys/Commanders, Jameis Winston “Mic’d Up” in the snow, Baker doing his best Tommy Cutlets impression, and more. Finally, we have what you’ve all been waiting for, our review of the 1989 classic Road House. We discuss everything from the insane bar fights, the sexiness of 80s Swayze, the most insane one-liner we’ve ever heard, and why this movie might need to be the new “Jumanji” in your household.

Right now you can get NFL Sunday Ticket for just 89 dollars. \n\nOffer ends December 2, Terms and embargoes apply.\n\nIn this episode, Jason and Travis discuss Mama Kelce’s small-screen debut, get Jason’s thoughts on his live performance and the Linc, and a tubular meat world record devolves into…well you’ll see. Sorry. \n\nWe also get Travis thoughts on the Chief's first loss of the season and how they plan to bounce back next week. Jason also tells us if Coach Sirianni has earned some love from the Philly fans and if Saquon Barkley should be in the MVP discussion. \n\nNext, we look at the rest of Week 11 in the NFL including the Steelers proving that field goals still matter, which teams might be making some coaching changes soon, and the guys share their honest thoughts on the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight. \n\nFinally, we dip into the Heights Hotline for some calls about the official 92% greeting, when to put up the Christmas tree, and why Jason doesn’t do the dishes. \n\nYou can listen to new episodes early and ad-free on Wondery+.

We also get his thoughts on LeBron’s misspelled shout-out, the backup career we never could’ve guessed, how the Dodgers dealt with the media circus surrounding Shohei Ohtani, if he thinks Anthony Rizzo should’ve pitched in the World Series, why Bad Bunny is his choice for walk-up music, and so much more!

      "description": "92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights! In this episode, we are joined by an incredible guest MLB legend CC Sabathia! Before we get to CC, we address Jason being called out to kick for a good cause, provide an update on the ‘Heights Hotline,’ and react to the famous reactions we got from our Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants review. We’ve also got a full recap of Jason getting Outta the House at the Eras tour in Miami, Travis breaking down the Chiefs' Super Bowl rematch against the Niners, and a look at some of the best internet reactions to Pat Mahomes ‘dad bod’ TD that broke the internet. We also get into everything else from Week 7 in the NFL including Jason’s thoughts on Saquon going off against the Giants, reactions to a huge NFC North showdown, and try and explain why Jets fans might be losing their minds. Finally, we sit down for an incredible conversation with CC Sabathia. The guys get into everything from why this might be the best World Series of all time, if NFL players could make it in the majors, the hitters he’s glad to never face again, and so much more!

      "description": "92%ers, we are back with the 100th episode of New Heights brought to you by Buffalo Wild Wings! In this episode, we kick off the first week of football by visiting with an old friend, revealing who is going to be in this year’s Philly Christmas Album, and explain why you probably saw Jason shirtless washing a truck. Travis also breaks down everything from the Chiefs toenail biter of a win against the Ravens. We get his thoughts on the new offensive weapons, the defenses ability to slow down Lamar Jackson, and why Isaiah Likely might need some French tip cleats. Jason also shares his thoughts on the birds big win over the Packers down in Brazil, his thoughts on the new look tush push, and the debut of Saquon Barkley in an Eagles uniform. We also look at all the major headlines from Week 1 in the NFL including the QB struggles all around the league, Caleb Williams first win, and a few major week 1 upsets. Finally, we get Outta the House with Jason’s busting out of his shirt on Monday Night Countdown and Travis using the US Open as the perfect place to watch football.

Travis also breaks down everything from the Chiefs toenail biter of a win against the Ravens. We get his thoughts on the new offensive weapons, the defenses ability to slow down Lamar Jackson, and why Isaiah Likely might need some French tip cleats. Jason also shares his thoughts on the birds big win over the Packers down in Brazil, his thoughts on the new look tush push, and the debut of Saquon Barkley in an Eagles uniform. We also look at all the major headlines from Week 1 in the NFL including the QB struggles all around the league, Caleb Williams first win, and a few major week 1 upsets. Finally, we get Outta the House with Jason’s busting out of his shirt on Monday Night Countdown and Travis using the US Open as the perfect place to watch football.

      "description": "92%ers, we are back with another fantastic episode of New Heights brought to you by NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV. In this episode, we’ve got a lot to get to before the NFL season officially kicks off. We start things with Jason’s update on how he feels about Twitter polls, the results of a questionable llama costume contest, Travis’ new horse, and the guys' reaction to LeBron James’ tight end Mt. Rushmore. Next, Travis breaks down how he’s feeling going into season 12 in the NFL, his thoughts on some of his new teammates, and a preview of the Week 1 match-up against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. After that, we find out what Jason was up to at Eagles camp, if he’s any closer to joining the coaching staff, and his thoughts on how Jalen Hurts will develop without him at center. Finally, we let you know all the week 1 games that are worth watching, settle the debate on Travis’ eye color, and decide how many wind sprints are too many wind sprints after chugging a pitcher. Kelce Car Jam: Year 2 is going to be on Saturday, Oct 5th. Check out the @87running Instagram or visit https://87running.org/ to grab your tickets.

      "description": "92%ers, we are back with the Season 3 premiere of New Heights, brought to you exclusively by NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV. In this episode, we get everyone caught up on everything we’ve been up to in the offseason and have an incredible conversation with the absolute legend, Happy Gilmore himself, Adam Sandler. First, Travis breaks down what went down at Chiefs Training camp including his thoughts on the three-peat, how his National Title run went in CFB 25, and what happened on the best play of the preseason, Pat Mahomes going behind the back. After that Jason gives us a full recap of his time in Paris rooting on Team USA at the Olympics. We get his opinion on field hockey rules, why he wasn’t cheating at arm wrestling, and which sport Travis might be signing up for at the LA2028 games. Finally, we get to our electric conversation with Adam Sandler. We talk about his new Netflix special, how he got Travis involved in Happy Gilmore 2, how early he thinks you should expose kids to the Sand Man, and what he thinks Bobby Boucher is doing today.

But we've got some important business to get to in this episode including, responding to Ryan Reynolds' and Rob McElhenney's plan to get us to a Wrexham game overseas and Pat Mahomes' claim that he can't keep up with the Kelce boys. We also have the reveal of Kylie's anniversary sword, our reactions to the roast of Tom Brady, Travis gives us all the details on his time at the races in Kentucky and Miami, and Jason is maybe starting a feud with Secretariat. That horse could outrun the competition but not the asterisk we're adding to the record books. We finally check in on the NFL now that we're 120 days until kickoff and break down what fans should take away from rookie mini-camps and react to all the guys maybe doing too much in their social media workouts. Don't forget to check out all the videos from our live show in Cincinnati. The team did some amazing work on all of those, and who knows, maybe you will solve the mystery of Jason's missing ring. We will be back with more New Heights every Wednesday during the offseason so make sure you're subscribed to our YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don't miss a single episode and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show. . . .

You'll find out which events left people unable to stand, how close we came to a chili pool fist fight, what happened to Jason's Super Bowl ring, why we think more contestants should have tried cheating, and the real reason we should be mad at Travis for what happened at the \"graduation.\" The full Lombaby Games as well as our conversations with Desmond Ridder. Orlando Brown Jr. and Joe Burrow will be available on our YouTube page soon. Jason also walks us through his time in the ring at Wrestlemania, Travis breaks down his trip to Coachella, and then we answer some \"No Dumb Questions\" where we somehow invent a more dangerous version of skydiving. Finally, we close with some actual NFL news with the Eagles signing some big-time extensions, our thoughts on the Brazil game, and the Chiefs new international acquisition. We will be back with more New Heights every Wednesday during the offseason so make sure you're subscribed to our YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don't miss a single episode and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show. . . .

      "description": "92%ers we are back with another special guest episode of New Heights sponsored by Buffalo Wild Wings. Let's Go Sports Bar! In this episode, we got a chance to sit down with the insanely talented rapper, actor, producer, director and most importantly, die-hard Philadelphia sports fan, Lil Dicky! The guys talk to Lil Dicky about what's next for him after the release of his album \"Penith\" and the news that his show \"Dave\" is going on hiatus (8:30). Lil Dicky also delves into the making of his show, what it was like shooting scenes with Brad Pitt and which guest star he's most surprised agreed to join the show (11:20). We then get into Lil Dicky's early career beginnings (27:10), funding his first music videos with bar mitzvah money, his musical background (33:30), as well as the intensity of his high school tennis team (36:01)! Dave also shares his \"Welcome to the Industry\" moment (41:00). We also talk all about Lil Dicky's lifelong Philadelphia sports fandom, including what makes Philly fans so different and why Jason's Super Bowl victory speech means so much to him (45:02). Lil Dicky also gives his thoughts on \"The Process\" (1:03:05), explains his rap name origin story (01:19:45) and gives us his Mt. Rushmore of rappers-turned-actors (01:13:50).

We also still want to see all the 92%ers live and in person at our show in Cincinnati on April 11th. Tickets available at http://Gobearcats.com/NewHeights In this episode, we've got an incredible guest with us, the brand-new Philadelphia Eagle Saquon Barkley! Saquon and the guys get into everything about his huge offseason signing with the Philadelphia Eagles, how he feels about Giants fans' reaction, which Eagles have already welcomed him into the locker room, and if he can somehow get Jason out of retirement. We also break down what it was like for Saquon to be back on campus at Penn State, how close he was to getting drafted by the Browns, how he feels about the current state of NFL runningbacks, if he thinks Jets Jake could get past the line of scrimmage, and how he feels about his inevitable weight room showdown with Jalen Hurts.

If you're looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. We're breaking down all the biggest moves in NFL free agency so far, talking about Travis' latest trip abroad, what Jason's been up to in his first week since retirement and so much more! But first, Jason and Travis react to the news that they won \"Podcast of the Year\" and \"Best Ensemble\" at the 2024 iHeart Podcast Awards (1:56). The guys also talk about their upcoming trip back home to the University of Cincinnati (5:12). Stay tuned for more details! Then we check out some fan mentions, first from Drew Brees who announced he's sponsoring 13 scholarships for walk-ons in honor of Jason's 13 NFL seasons (8:14). We also got a shout out from \"Forged in Fire\" judge Doug Marcaida who invited us to the forge (10:39)! Next, we get into Travis' latest trip abroad to Singapore (31:03) and what Jason has been up to since officially deciding to hang 'em up, including becoming Beau Allen's personal Uber driver (36:40). And lastly, we get into all the biggest moves from the start of free agency, beginning with Russell Wilson's decision to sign with the Steelers and Kirk Cousins signing a huge deal with the Falcons (41:04). We then talk about all the Chiefs roster moves so far, including Chris Jones' record big pay day (47:33). Jason then weighs in on the news coming out of Philadelphia, highlighting Fletcher Cox's retirement and the Eagles signing Saquon Barkley (59:36)! We wrap things up by talking about some of the most surprising moves and all the running backs that have new homes in 2024 (01:15:10).

If you're looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. In this episode, we've got to start (01:45) with a huge thank you to the over thirty-six thousand of you who entered our first-ever bracket challenge, a full breakdown of Jason becoming the most beloved drive-through customer at McDonald's, and a reaction to Chris Jones discovering that no one has ever said \"Kelce\" right. Travis recaps everything that happened ON the field in Buffalo (19:55) including his thoughts on Patrick Mahomes' first road playoff performance, breaking a Gronk playoff record, why he owes Mecole Hardman an apology, and what he said to Josh Allen in the tunnel at halftime. And you know we gotta talk about it. Jason breaks down everything that happened during his time with Bill's mafia (48:00). We touch on everything from what he drank from the bowling ball, what Kylie thought of his decision to go shirtless, and if this was the perfect way to make a first impression. We also recap everything else that went down during the divisional round (01:10:31) including the Ravens suffocating win over Houston, the Lions, and the Niners pulling out a win against the Packers. We will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs AFC Championship game in Baltimore and a full breakdown of the second round of our \"Best Team Name\" bracket challenge.

If you're looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. In this episode, we've got to start (01:45) with a huge thank you to the over thirty-six thousand of you who entered our first-ever bracket challenge, a full breakdown of Jason becoming the most beloved drive-through customer at McDonald's, and a reaction to Chris Jones discovering that no one has ever said \"Kelce\" right. Travis recaps everything that happened ON the field in Buffalo (19:55) including his thoughts on Patrick Mahomes' first road playoff performance, breaking a Gronk playoff record, why he owes Mecole Hardman an apology, and what he said to Josh Allen in the tunnel at halftime. And you know we gotta talk about it. Jason breaks down everything that happened during his time with Bill's mafia (48:00). We touch on everything from what he drank from the bowling ball, what Kylie thought of his decision to go shirtless, and if this was the perfect way to make a first impression. We also recap everything else that went down during the divisional round (01:10:31) including the Ravens suffocating win over Houston, the Lions, and the Niners pulling out a win against the Packers. We will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs AFC Championship game in Baltimore and a full breakdown of the second round of our \"Best Team Name\" bracket challenge.

If you're looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. In this episode, we quickly settle the debate on the better All-Pro award and decide to go ahead and rig the vote to get Travis a People's Choice Award. Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athlete Then we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. And for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full \"Best Team Name\" bracket and link to enter later today. Follow us on social for details.

Stroud taking on the Browns defense, and Mike McCarthy getting a shot at his old team in Dallas.\n\nWe also explain why Jamies Winston might be the greatest teammate of all time, what happens to Eric Bienemy in Washington, and finally give a Stamp of the Week to a guy who has been tearing it up all year.\n\nWe will return Friday with a preview of the wildcard games with the Dolphins at Chiefs and the Eagles heading to the Bucs.

We answer some \"No Dumb Questions\" about how players being Mic'd Up works, how much planning goes into touchdown celebrations, and our top 5 cereals. We then get into a buns week 13 for the Eagles and Chiefs. Jason explains what the Eagles are taking away from the 49ers game and how Shaq Leonard is bringing depth at the right time. Meanwhile, Travis walks us through the Chiefs Lambeau Letdown and shares his thoughts on the controversial calls that ended the game. Finally, we talk a little college football with the headline we can't ignore and explain how Florida State got screwed out of a shot at the playoff. We will be back Friday with a preview of the Bills at Chiefs and the Eagles at Dallas.

In this episode, we've got some big New News about our duet \"Fairytale of Philadelphia\" (5:30), Travis has a new collaboration with his clothing brand Tru Kolors (12:28) and Jason asks Travis about being the December/January cover star of Wall Street Journal Magazine (13:47). Jason also brings up Travis' old tweets from 2009 - 2011 that the entire country can't get enough of and Travis responds to how viral they've been going, highlighting his favorites (17:27). We also talk about the best and worst Thanksgiving dishes and power rank our top five Thanksgiving sides, including some hot takes on the best and worst pies (22:41). We then recap Eagles-Chiefs at Arrowhead, AKA the Kelce Family Reunion Game (33:35). Jason talks about the Eagles first half struggles on offense, making big plays when it mattered most and Chris Jones' dominant performance (49:05). Travis discusses his touchdown, the Chiefs defense and the turnover battle (1:00:15). Then, in our Week 11 round up, we break down Browns DE Myles Garrett picking up another Steelers QB helmet with a much different result (1:11:50) and Alex Smith's recent comments about Travis on his radio show (1:12:40). Lastly, we hand out our New Heights Stamps of the Week to the players who took their games to new heights in Week 11 of NFL action (1:18:55). We will be back Friday with a preview of Chiefs at Raiders and Bills at Eagles.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with a special guest episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Experian and the all-new Experian Debit Card and Digital checking account! In this episode, we're joined by Jason's teammate Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata to talk about the new Eagles Christmas album (2:27), and the guys also revisit a not-dumb question about rugby players in the NFL utilizing Jordan's rugby expertise (12:29). Jordan also shares more about his path from Rugby League to the NFL, including his first exposure to the NFL, how he chose his position, how NFL scouts found him, and where he first started training to play football (24:45). Travis and Jason then ask Jordan about the lead-up to his NFL Draft experience, how he felt when he was selected by the Eagles in the seventh round, and who he spoke to first within the organization (38:18). Jordan also talks about the culture shock that happened upon his move from Australia to Philadelphia (45:52), his first days with the Eagles (50:54), and his \"Welcome to the NFL\" moment (59:27). Jason and Jordan get into the 2023 Eagles team, highlighting their roles in the \"Brotherly Shove\" play (1:04:20) and Jordan's relationship with quarterback Jalen Hurts (1:11:04). Lastly, Jordan gives his Mt. Rushmore of the Greatest Australians of All-Time (1:15:21), Jason tries Australian candy (1:34:26) and the guys ask Jordan a series of rapid-fire questions, covering topics like how many toes Jordan has and his time on \"The Masked Singer\" (1:22:25).

Travis also defends National Tight End Day (42:20), breaks down the Chiefs offensive explosion against the Chargers (47:03), and how he feels about the media inventing \"Swift Stats.\" (56:20) Jason gives us his full reaction to the Eagles finally bringing back the Kelly Greens in their win over the Dolphins (59:55), what it's really like at the bottom of the \"Brotherly Shove\" pile (01:06:44), and how the Eagles D kept Tyreek Hill in check (01:14:08). The guys also weigh in on Myles Garrett possibly beating the Colts by himself (01:25:00), all the huge TE stats from National Tight End Day (01:28:00), and if they'll be participating in Olympic Flag Football (01:31:32). We will be back with our weekend preview video on Friday where we look at both the Chiefs and Eagles huge divisional road games, one of the greatest hits of all time, and what Jason is \"dressing as\" for Halloween.

Travis also breaks down Chiefs/Broncos on Thursday night football (30:52) including what he was thinking on that lateral play (37:40), how the Chiefs are improving in the red zone (40:45), and the momentous occasion that was Big Ed Kelce the Swiftie (45:10).

We also recap Jason's first trip to SoFi Stadium, his reaction to the Swiftie that caught his pre-game warmup, the new way the NFL might ban the \"Brotherly Shove,\" and why he got heated on the sideline. Also, we get into Travis' trip to Minnesota and our thoughts on the renewed call to ban turf fields, how it felt to come back in the game and immediately find the end zone, and how the Chiefs offense can start helping out the defense. We also look at other huge stories from Week 5 with the 'Nathaniel Hackett Bowl,\" Dolphins' historic offense output, Niners' huge win against the Cowboys, and the secrets to traveling internationally for games.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with a special guest episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! In this episode, we're joined by Kansas City Chiefs DT Chris \"Stone Cold\" Jones! The guys talk to Chris about his new contract (01:52), what it's really like to miss training camp (3:30), and if he thinks this current Chiefs defense isn't being talked about enough (5:13). Jason, Travis and Chris also answer your not-dumb question about which NFL players should join the WWE when they retire (6:20). Chris then shares his Draft day story (10:03) and also breaks down exactly what happened during his famous wardrobe malfunction at the Combine (14:17). We then hear about Chris' early experiences with the Chiefs, including his brutally honest first impression of Travis and how he handled his first Andy Reid long drive drill (20:36). The guys get into some of Chris' career milestones, including his first sack on Andrew Luck (26:20) and his first interception in a big 2017 win vs. Jason and the Eagles (30:17). Chris also talks about his NFL record-setting sack streak and his superstitious desire to wear the same gloves for each of those 11 games (33:16). Travis and Chris also delve into each of their Super Bowl appearances together and Chris shares exactly why one of the wins meant even more to him (35:10). Lastly, Chris names the guys on his defensive line Mt. Rushmore (48:03) and the guys play a round of \"We Gotta Ask But You Don't Have to Answer\" where Chris talks about his twitter beef with Tyreek Hill (51:19) and the most annoying thing about offensive linemen (54:02).

We also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears (25:29). We'll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red's career milestone (30:17 ), and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom (31:51). Also, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties (41:21), try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos (49:07), and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. This Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris \"Stone Cold\" Jones!

In this episode, we finally address the topic that you guys have been blowing us up about, did Jason ever find his Super Bowl ring? We also answer your not-dumb questions about the most quotable movie and find out why Travis is so good at taping ankles. We also get to talk about the Eagles bringing back the most dominant play in football, the D'Andre Swift breakout game on Thursday Night Football, and why we don't actually hate the touchback rule. Travis also lets us know where he got his twerking inspiration from, how it felt to finally get back on the field, and his thoughts on reaching yet another Tight End milestone. The guys also go around the league for the biggest Week 2 takeaways, why we believe in Coach Prime, how much fun it is when the refs talk back, and marvel at Bill Belichick's challenge flag toss. We will be back later this week with a video previewing the Eagles and Chiefs Week 3 games and another all new episode every Wednesday during the NFL season.

In this episode, we've got a guest that you guys have been asking for since we started this show. The field hockey phenom, the mother of three future Andy Reid Draft Picks, and Jason's incredible wife, Kylie Kelce! (02:30) In this incredible conversation with Kylie, we get her thoughts on the upcoming 'Kelce' Documentary (04:15), her take on the chaos that was Catching Kelce, why she doesn't play matchmaker for Travis (19:51), and what she really thought of Jason from his Tinder profile. (23:50) We also get the wild backstory on how Jason proposed (38:45), how Kylie dealt with almost giving birth at the Super Bowl (59:24), why the Kelce brothers were both kicked out of preschool (01:14:00) and what she really thinks of Jason and Travis podcasting (01:24:00).

(23:50) We also get the wild backstory on how Jason proposed (38:45), how Kylie dealt with almost giving birth at the Super Bowl (59:24), why the Kelce brothers were both kicked out of preschool (01:14:00) and what she really thinks of Jason and Travis podcasting (01:24:00).

      "description": "92%ers we are a little late but we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball. In this episode, we are joined by maybe the most interesting man in the world, former Army Ranger turned Pro-Bowl left tackle for the Pittsburgh Steelers Alejandro Villanueva. In our incredible conversation with Alejandro, we get the back story on what happened when he was cut from the Eagles (17:55), why he thinks the NFL Regional Combine is a scam (31:00), how he gained almost 100lbs to play for the Steelers (37:02), what is was really like going up against Jame Harrison in practice every day (49:20), and why Mike Tomlin might be selling himself short (56:26). We also touch on his time in the US Army and his path to playing football at West Point (58:02), what it was really like to serve three tours in Afghanistan (01:06:45), and how he became an Army Ranger (01:18:00). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

We also touch on his time in the US Army and his path to playing football at West Point (58:02), what it was really like to serve three tours in Afghanistan (01:06:45), and how he became an Army Ranger (01:18:00). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show. One final programming note. We will be dropping our video from the first ever New Heights Beer Bowl next week, so subscribe and turn your notifications on so you don't miss it.

NBA Hall of Famer, Emmy Winner, Olympics Gold medalist, the round mound of rebound…Charles Barkley! Before we get to Charles, Travis has to address some rumors that we might have started on this show, we recap the Chiefs' visit to the White House and what Travis was going to say at the podium, and we give you guys an update on the Ocean Drive Beer Bowl. In our great conversation with Sir Charles Barkley, we find out why Charles decided football was NOT for him, what it was like living next door to Mike Tyson, how he knew it was time to retire, what it takes to play in Philly and who he's picking in the NBA finals. We also get the incredible story about playing against a young Dirk Nowitzki, his welcome to the NBA moment, why Kobe wasn't a fit for Inside the NBA, the truth about the rumor Michael Jordan used golf to beat him in the '93 finals, and the one thing he stole from his time with The Dream Team.

In our great conversation with Sir Charles Barkley, we find out why Charles decided football was NOT for him, what it was like living next door to Mike Tyson, how he knew it was time to retire, what it takes to play in Philly and who he's picking in the NBA finals. We also get the incredible story about playing against a young Dirk Nowitzki, his welcome to the NBA moment, why Kobe wasn't a fit for Inside the NBA, the truth about the rumor Michael Jordan used golf to beat him in the '93 finals, and the one thing he stole from his time with The Dream Team. As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show. There is still time to submit your entry to the Ocean Drive Charity Beer Bowl.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball. In this episode, we are joined by an NFL Hall of Famer, Tight End legend, and the man better known as \"Unc,\" Shannon Sharpe. Shannon talks with the guys about how his mentoring relationship with Travis started (07:20), how the secret to Tight End success might be all in the hips (14:30), and who is on Shannon's TE Mt. Rushmore. (21:00) We dive into how Shannon was almost cut from the Broncos (35:11), which records he doesn't think anyone will ever touch (31:15), why he'd be putting up \"Travis numbers\" in the modern NFL (46:15), and why he'd swap places with his brother Sterling if given the chance (01:06:05). Shannon also gives us his thoughts on the 2000s Raven's defense (01:17:25), if anyone in the NFL would block for Skip Bayless (01:22:55), why LeBron James wouldn't be a great NFL Tight End (01:24:15), and what advice he'd give his rookie self (01:26:35). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

Rushmore. (21:00) We dive into how Shannon was almost cut from the Broncos (35:11), which records he doesn't think anyone will ever touch (31:15), why he'd be putting up \"Travis numbers\" in the modern NFL (46:15), and why he'd swap places with his brother Sterling if given the chance (01:06:05). Shannon also gives us his thoughts on the 2000s Raven's defense (01:17:25), if anyone in the NFL would block for Skip Bayless (01:22:55), why LeBron James wouldn't be a great NFL Tight End (01:24:15), and what advice he'd give his rookie self (01:26:35). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show. Live Show Tickets: If you still want to win tickets to the live show in Kansas City all you gotta do is let us know why you're the 1% of the 92%.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with episode thirty-four of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball. In this episode, we have a huge update about how you could snag some tickets to the live show in Kansas City (03:40), we get Travis' thoughts on going viral last week (14:33) and dive back into a debate that has haunted this show for months, can NFL players hoop? (18:51) We also get Travis' story about stepping into the batter's box against a Cy Young winner (21:21), Jason has some advice for all the potential new dads out there (25:08), and we have our first-ever New Heights mock draft about what else, Easter Candy. (28:02) This episode also includes Jason's incredible conversation with the new head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Shane Steichen. (35:15) Jason and Shane touch on everything from his first day in Philly (36:30), coaching up Justin Herbert and Philip Rivers (39:20), what goes into an NFL game plan, the secrets to being a good play caller (46:15), why he loves watching QBs throw live (56:21), and the importance of a pre-game ritual. (01:03:30) Finally, we close out by talking about which game shows from our childhood we'd dominate (01:12:00), the reason Jason always loved seeing the US kick ass in Global Guts (01:15:00), and how to correctly pick a winner on Legends of the Hidden Temple.

      "description": "92%ers we are back with the thirtieth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball and we have an exceptional one for you guys. In this episode, we are talking about all things NFL Combine. Yes, we know this is the start of tampering season, but with Travis hosting SNL we had to delay the recording on this one a little bit. We break down how getting invited to the combine actually works (07:10), what kind of training goes into preparing for the on-field drills (10:00) and revisit some of the formal interviews that didn't go exactly as planned (17:35). Next, we tell you what to actually look for when you're watching players do drills (35:50), debate if we should retake the Wonderlic (37:40), and Jason gives us a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like being back at the NFL Combine as a veteran (43:30). We also have an incredible conversation with former Eagles scout and current NFL Network Draft Analyst, Daniel Jeremiah (45:42). The guys touch on why the Combine still matters (46:20), the players you have to see in person to appreciate (56:55), if Philly will draft a running back (01:02:27), Jason's actual scouting report (01:09:10), and how Daniel jumped from NFL scouting to media (01:10:57). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

      "content": "92%ers we are back with the thirtieth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball and we have an exceptional one for you guys. In this episode, we are talking about all things NFL Combine. Yes, we know this is the start of tampering season, but with Travis hosting SNL we had to delay the recording on this one a little bit. We break down how getting invited to the combine actually works (07:10), what kind of training goes into preparing for the on-field drills (10:00) and revisit some of the formal interviews that didn't go exactly as planned (17:35). Next, we tell you what to actually look for when you're watching players do drills (35:50), debate if we should retake the Wonderlic (37:40), and Jason gives us a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like being back at the NFL Combine as a veteran (43:30). We also have an incredible conversation with former Eagles scout and current NFL Network Draft Analyst, Daniel Jeremiah (45:42). The guys touch on why the Combine still matters (46:20), the players you have to see in person to appreciate (56:55), if Philly will draft a running back (01:02:27), Jason's actual scouting report (01:09:10), and how Daniel jumped from NFL scouting to media (01:10:57). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

On this episode we jump right into the biggest 'New News,' we've got a New Niece and why Jason doesn't think he'll win father of the year anytime soon (03:22). We also look at some Calvin and Hobbes-inspired fan art (08:49), and crown the Quip Podcast MVP (09:57). Do we mostly just play around with an overpowered water flosser? Yes. But a trophy does change hands at some point. Next, we break down the incredible post-Super Bowl run that Travis has been on. From dodging projectile beer cans at the Chiefs victory parade (16:50), singing with Jimmy Fallon (23:40), and going live from Studio 8H to host Saturday Night Live (29:30). Travis answers all the big questions about hosting SNL. What is the week like (31:20), who was the unsung hero of the week (56:00), what was his favorite sketch (01:01:05), and most importantly, what time did he get home from the SNL afterparty? (01:03:50) Finally, Jason fills us in on what he was up to at the combine (01:15:27), what big-name guests he talked to (01:23:30), and gives us a preview of our incredible interview with Howie Roseman that we will be dropping soon (01:26:30).

      "description": "On the twenty-eighth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball, this is the definitive recap of Super Bowl 57. Jason and Travis weigh in on what they thought of the field conditions during pre-game warm-ups (23:53), what they felt during the anthem (34:00), what it was like seeing Donna Kelce on the jumbotron (38:45), and if there was any shit-talking during the coin toss (41:01). We then break down the game itself starting with a very Kelce-centric first quarter (42:05), how the Eagles responded to a huge second-quarter turnover (45:05), and what adjustments the Chiefs made in the locker room at halftime (48:34). We also touch on the Chiefs starting the second half strong (53:23), how the Chiefs tied it all up with a play called \"corn dog(55:51),\" the third down play that Jason is still thinking about (57:10), Jalen Hurts 4th quarter drive to tie the game (01:00:20), and Travis walks us through the Chiefs go-ahead field goal to clinch Super Bowl 57 (01:01:20). Jason and Travis then give their final thoughts on the game's \"controversial\" ending (01:05:26), the enormous emotions they were feeling seeing their family on the field (01:21:02), and Jason reveals the one thing that could have made this the greatest Super Bowl of all time (01:28:00). After the game discussion, we finally have Travis make his pick for the long-awaited name of the New Heights fan base (01:29:50), we answer a not-dumb question about the inevitable casting of the \"Kelce Bowl\" movie (01:33:53), and we talk a little bit about what we have planned next for the show (01:48:11).

      "summary": "On the twenty-eighth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball, this is the definitive recap of Super Bowl 57.\n\nJason and Travis weigh in on what they thought of the field conditions during pre-game warm-ups (23:53), what they felt during the anthem (34:00), what it was like seeing Donna Kelce on the jumbotron (38:45), and if there was any shit-talking during the coin toss (41:01).\n\nWe then break down the game itself starting with a very Kelce-centric first quarter (42:05), how the Eagles responded to a huge second-quarter turnover (45:05), and what adjustments the Chiefs made in the locker room at halftime (48:34).\n\nWe also touch on the Chiefs starting the second half strong (53:23), how the Chiefs tied it all up with a play called \"corn dog(55:51),\" the third down play that Jason is still thinking about (57:10), Jalen Hurts 4th quarter drive to tie the game (01:00:20), and Travis walks us through the Chiefs go-ahead field goal to clinch Super Bowl 57 (01:01:20).\n\nJason and Travis then give their final thoughts on the game's \"controversial\" ending (01:05:26), the enormous emotions they were feeling seeing their family on the field (01:21:02), and Jason reveals the one thing that could have made this the greatest Super Bowl of all time (01:28:00).\n\nAfter the game discussion, we finally have Travis make his pick for the long-awaited name of the New Heights fan base (01:29:50), we answer a not-dumb question about the inevitable casting of the \"Kelce Bowl\" movie (01:33:53), and we talk a little bit about what we have planned next for the show (01:48:11).\n\nAs always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.\n\nMerch:\n\nhttps://homage.com/newheights\n\n\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",

      "description": "On the twenty-sixth episode of New Heights, we sit down with the two people the whole country has been waiting to hear from, Donna and Ed Kelce! Donna reveals how she feels about the Kelce bowl (07:00), who she's really rooting for during the game (10:00), and if she's going to actually do the pregame coin toss (16:30). We also get answers on who broke the couch growing up (27:20), if Mom really wanted a daughter (29:20) and the truth behind Travis' name (30:25). We dig into some family secrets about raising Jason and Travis (35:15), what it's like to be a parent to NFL players (43:45), if Grandpa maybe committed some light treason (49:10), and if we need to run it back next year (01:05:20). Next, we've got Ed Kelce who shares his candid thoughts on who's winning the Kelce Bowl (01:08:35), what it was like coaching Jason and Travis growing up (01:32:40), and why he went to such great lengths to make sure they had a great Christmas every year (01:47:55). We finally get Dad to reveal some incredible family stories including why pizza rolls counted as a vegetable growing up (02:00:50), why no one knows how to pronounce Kelce (02:06:18), what was his plan if he actually heard from aliens (02:07:53), when the last time he stole from the library was (02:11:40), and dad's favorite story of household destruction (02:14:30).

      "description": "On the twenty-fifth episode of New Heights, the Kelce Bowl is officially happening! Over the weekend everyone's phones exploded with all the Kelce Bowl shoutouts (02:50). So we try and recap some of our favorites in New News, show off some of the new merch we're dropping to celebrate the occasion (12:10), and look at some of our favorite fan art that you guys sent us over the week (16:15). Then we get into Championship Sunday starting with the Niners heading to Philly(20:04), Jason's thoughts on the Davonta Smith \"catch,\" (23:25) what the Eagles sideline was really saying after the Brock Purdy injury (30:03), and why you can't chirp back to Eagles fans if you're an opposing player (41:00). Next, we hit the wildly anticipated Bengals and Chiefs rematch and Travis' thoughts on the newly named \"Burrowhead\" stadium (48:05), why he had to cut a promo on the Mayor of Cincinnati (55:27), what Andy Reid told him on the sidelines after the lateral(01:04:15), how the Chiefs overcame an enormous amount of injuries to clinch the AFC (01:05:56), and our thoughts the roughing the passer call that cost the Bengals the game (01:14:30). We hand out some of our final in-season Stamps of the Week to the Chiefs trainers that kept Travis on the field and some Philly fans that couldn't stay on top of a bus stop (01:18:43). We also answer an incredibly not dumb question about the best kind of bowl, trust us it will make sense when you hear it (01:25:56). Finally, we get to what everyone won't stop talking about, The Kelce Bowl (01:36:19). Jason and Travis share how they really feel being the first brothers to go head to head in a Super Bowl, who is in charge of handing out tickets to the family, and what storylines you should actually be paying attention to before the Super Bowl. Last, we have some Pod business to fill you guys in on in our new segment \"quick outs.\" We've got some updates on the fanbase name, the ransom we're prepared to offer for the Chad Henne ball, how we need your help with our Reddit page, and the event New Heights will be hosting in Arizona next week (01:48:30). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

      "content": "On the twenty-fifth episode of New Heights, the Kelce Bowl is officially happening! Over the weekend everyone's phones exploded with all the Kelce Bowl shoutouts (02:50). So we try and recap some of our favorites in New News, show off some of the new merch we're dropping to celebrate the occasion (12:10), and look at some of our favorite fan art that you guys sent us over the week (16:15). Then we get into Championship Sunday starting with the Niners heading to Philly(20:04), Jason's thoughts on the Davonta Smith \"catch,\" (23:25) what the Eagles sideline was really saying after the Brock Purdy injury (30:03), and why you can't chirp back to Eagles fans if you're an opposing player (41:00). Next, we hit the wildly anticipated Bengals and Chiefs rematch and Travis' thoughts on the newly named \"Burrowhead\" stadium (48:05), why he had to cut a promo on the Mayor of Cincinnati (55:27), what Andy Reid told him on the sidelines after the lateral(01:04:15), how the Chiefs overcame an enormous amount of injuries to clinch the AFC (01:05:56), and our thoughts the roughing the passer call that cost the Bengals the game (01:14:30). We hand out some of our final in-season Stamps of the Week to the Chiefs trainers that kept Travis on the field and some Philly fans that couldn't stay on top of a bus stop (01:18:43). We also answer an incredibly not dumb question about the best kind of bowl, trust us it will make sense when you hear it (01:25:56). Finally, we get to what everyone won't stop talking about, The Kelce Bowl (01:36:19). Jason and Travis share how they really feel being the first brothers to go head to head in a Super Bowl, who is in charge of handing out tickets to the family, and what storylines you should actually be paying attention to before the Super Bowl. Last, we have some Pod business to fill you guys in on in our new segment \"quick outs.\" We've got some updates on the fanbase name, the ransom we're prepared to offer for the Chad Henne ball, how we need your help with our Reddit page, and the event New Heights will be hosting in Arizona next week (01:48:30). As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

We also recap the Bengals snowy win over the Bills (01:10:54), why Jason can relate to Stefon Diggs frustrations (01:14:50), and try to figure out what the hell was going on during the electric season-ending play the Cowboys rolled out against the 49ers (01:20:30).

Make sure you hit us in the comments below with how you think the guys' rankings hold up.\n\nAs always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n\n\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",

      "description": "On the twenty-second episode of New Heights, we've been asking you guys who you wanted on the show and there was one name that came up every time, or at least 92% of the time. So we finally got the 5x pro bowler, 4x first-team NFL all-pro, 4x Super Bowl Champion, and one of the best to ever do it, Rob Gronkowski. In this episode, Jason and Travis get the details about why Gronk is kicking a field goal at the Super Bowl (03:00), the return of \"Gronk Beach\" (06:20), and acting alongside GILFs (09:15). We find out whether we'll see Gronk return in the playoffs (11:20), why he's got an eye on the Buffalo Bills (17:00), why the Patriots were already yelling at him on Draft Day (20:30), and how he ended up at the University of Arizona (29:50). Travis and Jason get the behind-the-scenes stories from Gronk's rookie year with the Patriots (32:50), his first time meeting Tom Brady (35:50), the insanity that was trying to block Brandon Spikes (41:00), why Belichick is the greatest coach of all time (42:35), where he thinks Brady goes next (47:3-), and his welcome to the NFL moment with Vince Wilfork (48:50). Gronk opens up about what it's been like to constantly get compared to Travis and what TE records he hopes never get broken (51:10), why Jeremy Shockey was his TE role model (58:15), how the position has changed (01:00:50), and who's the next TE to watch out for (01:04:10). Finally, we get Gronk's POV on some of our signature segments with his Mt. Rushmore of NFL brothers (01:10:30), our not-dumb question about animals playing football (01:14:0), Gronk's advice to his younger self (01:19:00), and his stamp of the week that you absolutely don't see coming (01:21:20). Watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season & check us out on Instagram, Twitter and Tiktok for all the best moments from the show.

And finally, since we don't have a Chiefs or Eagles game to preview, we thought we would take a look back on the NFL regular season and hand out the first-ever New Heights Awards, The Newsies!

Jason recaps the Eagles game in Dallas (28:15), what Gardner Minshew is really like to play with (30:35), and why December football already feels like the playoffs (35:30). Later, we take a look back at some of Jason and Travis' favorite Pro Bowl Memories of the Bennett Brothers (44:00), we try to figure out what's going on in Broncos' Country (49:25), if the Mac Jones tackle was actually dirty (52:30), how they would handle the bizarre playoff scenario in the ACF South (59:10), and react to the new JJ Watt is retiring (01:01:05).

Thank you guys for sending so many great not dumb questions. Keep them coming. Also, Travis explains how we might not be giving enough credit to the 1-win Texans after they took the Chiefs to OT (25:52), what ridiculous record Patrick Mahomes might break next (31:50), and how Shannon Sharpe has been an incredible mentor throughout his career (33:10).

Then we look at the absolutely insane week 15 in the NFL. We hit everything from why we had so many one-score games (56:05), the Vikings' record-breaking comeback (59:50), maybe the first-ever snowball warning in Buffalo (01:03:36), and the completely unbelievable ending to the Patriots/Raiders game (01:05:40). We wrap with a look ahead to Week 16 with Jason's thoughts on the Micah Parson comments (01:16:20) before the Cowboys game and how Travis is prepping for his shot to maybe finally get a win over Geno Smith (01:21:43).

And we gotta talk about it, Travis breaks down the Chiefs coming up short against the Bengals (31:55), how he felt after the critical 4th quarter fumble (33:20), and after seeing \"Air Mahomes\" we debate if anyone in the NFL could play in the NBA (37:35). We also react to the breaking (at the time) news of Baker Mayfield signing with the Rams (49:55), examine Andrew Luck breaking his silence on retirement (53:00), take a look at some exciting sideline coaching moments from week 13 (01:01:50), and figure out what kind of coaches Peyton and Eli will be during the Pro Bowl (01:08:50). The guys also wonder why Jason didn't get the call for the Cincinnati Bearcats job (01:11:20) how Deion might fare at Colorado (01:15:08), and if we need more teams in the college football playoff (01:17:21). We wrap with a look ahead to both of our divisional showdowns (01:22:20) with the Eagles taking on the Giants and the Chiefs heading to Denver to see if Broncos country is still riding with Russell Wilson.

      "description": "On the fifteenth episode of New Heights, we finally got him despite the fastest invitation of all time (5:15). We finally got to sit down and have an incredible conversation with 4-time pro bowler, NFL MVP, and Super Bowl Champion Quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes. In this episode, Jason and Travis get Pat to explain why the Chiefs might not be running the QB sneak any time soon (6:50) We also dive into our most heated New Heights debate, who has the best fast food burger (11:40), the insane story about why Pat crushed his draft interview with Andy Reid (15:20), how his relationship with Alex Smith made him a better pro (20:35), and the legendary first meeting that led to his bromance with Travis (29:00). The guys also get the never before heard backstory of how Pat basically drafted himself in 2017 (47:10), how he's adjusted to running an offense with a Tight End (42:55), why his greatest rival might be the teleprompter (57:02), and his welcome to the NFL moment playing against Tom Brady (58:20). We also have some incredible stories behind his first start as a Chief (59:50 ) how he really feels about all those wild comebacks (01:07:10), his thoughts on all the MVP chatter (01:21:31), and all the comparisons to Michael Jordan and Steph Curry (01:27:40). Patrick also shares the superstitions he's kept with him since his rookie year (01:31:08), what rivalries he's got with other QBs (01:36:20), who is on his QB, Mt. Rushmore (01:38:30), and why Travis might not be the greatest beer pong partner (01:40:01).

We finally got to sit down and have an incredible conversation with 4-time pro bowler, NFL MVP, and Super Bowl Champion Quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes.\n\nIn this episode, Jason and Travis get Pat to explain why the Chiefs might not be running the QB sneak any time soon (6:50) We also dive into our most heated New Heights debate, who has the best fast food burger (11:40), the insane story about why Pat crushed his draft interview with Andy Reid (15:20), how his relationship with Alex Smith made him a better pro (20:35), and the legendary first meeting that led to his bromance with Travis (29:00).\n\nThe guys also get the never before heard backstory of how Pat basically drafted himself in 2017 (47:10), how he's adjusted to running an offense with a Tight End (42:55), why his greatest rival might be the teleprompter (57:02), and his welcome to the NFL moment playing against Tom Brady (58:20).\n\nWe also have some incredible stories behind his first start as a Chief (59:50 ) how he really feels about all those wild comebacks (01:07:10), his thoughts on all the MVP chatter (01:21:31), and all the comparisons to Michael Jordan and Steph Curry (01:27:40).\n\nPatrick also shares the superstitions he's kept with him since his rookie year (01:31:08), what rivalries he's got with other QBs (01:36:20), who is on his QB, Mt. Rushmore (01:38:30), and why Travis might not be the greatest beer pong partner (01:40:01).\n\nWatch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season &amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n\nAs always, thank you for watching and listening to the show send us questions, fan base suggestions, or anything on your mind to @NewHeightShow or email us at Newheights@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",

We break down our games from Week 12 starting with the Chiefs big win over the defending Super Bowl champion Rams(14:30). We find out how Travis almost called an insane audible during his biggest play of the game (16:00) and how he really feels about drawing the defense's best cover guy every week (18:13).

      "description": "On the twelfth episode of New Heights, we react to the incredible response to the Jalen Hurts episode (01:00) and see if Travis will finally be able to ask Patrick Mahomes to stop by (01:25) We also look at all of the great guest suggestions you sent in (05:00), more fanbase name ideas (6:30), and answer another of your great questions which leads to an incredible story of Travis' time as a telemarketer (9:40). We break down the games from week 10 starting with the Chiefs' offense continuing to spread the ball around to all of their playmakers (15:32) and what that means for Travis' role in the offense (17:50) and try to figure out how the hell the Giants let Kadarius Toney go (22:50). And it finally happened, the Eagles suffered their first loss on Monday Night Football and Jason gives us his biggest takeaway from the game (30:05), why he's sick of everyone rushing to blame it on the refs (31:10), and why going undefeated gets too hyped up by every team every year (37:10). Finally, we check out how the NFLPA is using New Heights to promote #Saferfields (42:50), find out which field left the biggest mark on Travis (46:15), and look at the incredible turnout from the German fans (50:08). We also answer some of the week's biggest questions; did the Bills and Vikings ruing the QB sneak (55:00), is there crying in football (01:01:50) and did Jeff Saturday earn himself a New Heights Stamp of the week (01:04:12)? We wrap with a look ahead to the Eagles heading to Indy to see Coach Jeff Saturday in person (01:07:25) and see if Travis will try and repeat his attempt to jump over Derwin James when the Chiefs take on the Chargers in LA (01:13:00).

      "content": "On the twelfth episode of New Heights, we react to the incredible response to the Jalen Hurts episode (01:00) and see if Travis will finally be able to ask Patrick Mahomes to stop by (01:25) We also look at all of the great guest suggestions you sent in (05:00), more fanbase name ideas (6:30), and answer another of your great questions which leads to an incredible story of Travis' time as a telemarketer (9:40). We break down the games from week 10 starting with the Chiefs' offense continuing to spread the ball around to all of their playmakers (15:32) and what that means for Travis' role in the offense (17:50) and try to figure out how the hell the Giants let Kadarius Toney go (22:50). And it finally happened, the Eagles suffered their first loss on Monday Night Football and Jason gives us his biggest takeaway from the game (30:05), why he's sick of everyone rushing to blame it on the refs (31:10), and why going undefeated gets too hyped up by every team every year (37:10). Finally, we check out how the NFLPA is using New Heights to promote #Saferfields (42:50), find out which field left the biggest mark on Travis (46:15), and look at the incredible turnout from the German fans (50:08). We also answer some of the week's biggest questions; did the Bills and Vikings ruing the QB sneak (55:00), is there crying in football (01:01:50) and did Jeff Saturday earn himself a New Heights Stamp of the week (01:04:12)? We wrap with a look ahead to the Eagles heading to Indy to see Coach Jeff Saturday in person (01:07:25) and see if Travis will try and repeat his attempt to jump over Derwin James when the Chiefs take on the Chargers in LA (01:13:00).

      "description": "On the eleventh episode of New Heights, we have our first-ever in-person sit-down interview with the #1 quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, Jalen Hurts. Jalen is currently having an MVP-caliber season so it's really exciting to be able to share this conversation with everyone. In this episode, Jason and Travis get an answer to maybe the most important New Heights question, what's Jalen calling on 4th & 1. (5:25) We also touch on Jalen's first impressions of being under center behind Jason (9:50), the backstory to the squat video everyone can't stop talking about (12:20), why he hopes Jason keeps playing for at least a few more years (23:02), and his surprising reaction to hearing his name called by the Eagles on Draft Night (26:00). The guys also chop it up about the philosophy of playing quarterback in the NFL (37:28), reveal Jalen's QB Mt. Rushmore (43:47), dive into his special relationship with the Manning family (48:36), get his real thoughts on the MVP conversation (54:47), and debate the right way for NFL players to watch football games (56:34). We also have some incredible stories of Jalen's time at Alabama (01:01:17) and how that prepared him for playing in front of Philly fans (01:06:18), his plans to teach Jason the griddy (01:12:25), and our first-ever guest New Heights Stamp of the Week (01:15:06).
